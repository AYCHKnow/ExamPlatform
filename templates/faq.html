        <p>As you may have noticed, this isn't a fully working application. This is a final project for the Front-End Development part of the Full-Stack Software Developer course from Code Institute. This is a showcase of the skills I've learned so far and kind of a proof of concept</p>

            <div class="collapsible-body">
              <p>It's for all your multiple choice quizzing and examination needs :) This is a front-end web development project for a hypothetical examination app.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons deep-orange-text text-lighten-1">live_help</i>What does it do?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
              <p>It contains informational views about the application and services offered, such as: faq, pricing, exam list, &amp; login/registration forms. It also allows you to take a sample interactive exam and provide be provided with score report at end</p>
              <p>The idea is that the complete app would allows organizations to host their multiple choice exams/quizzes and users could register to take them. However, no backend for this to be possible is going to be implemented at this stage. This is more of a proof of concept with focus on front end and set of of AngualrJS templates, controllers, routes, and services.</p>

            <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons deep-orange-text text-lighten-1">live_help</i>How does it work?</div>
            <div class="collapsible-body">
              <p>This is a Single Page Application on AngularJS and uses JSON data to generate exam questions and answers. The site is styled with MaterializeCSS.</p>
